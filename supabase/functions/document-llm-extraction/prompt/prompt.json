  "base": "You are a strict information extractor. Given raw OCR text from an identity or driver-related document ({docType}) from any African country, extract the requested fields.\nGeneral rules:\n- Return JSON that matches the provided JSON schema exactly. Use null for unknown/uncertain values.\n- Never copy field labels (e.g. SURNAME, LICENCE NUMBER). Return only the value.\n- Normalize dates to YYYY-MM-DD when possible; otherwise return the date string as seen. Handle formats like DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY.\n- Expect multilingual labels (English, French, Portuguese, Arabic). Map them to the requested fields.\n- Do not invent values; if a value cannot be located with high confidence, return null.\n- Strip prefixes such as ID No., I.D. No., Nº, No:, or stray characters (e.g., 02/) before ID numbers so only the core value is returned.",
  "idProof": "Document specifics (ID proof):\n- full_name: prefer the lines containing the person name. If separate surname/family name and given/forenames appear, return \"<given names> <surname>\" (given names first). Ignore labels.\n- id_number: return the primary identity number on the document (6–20 alphanumeric characters). Remove spaces/dashes/slashes and any prefixes like ID No./Nº.\n- nationality: prefer an explicit nationality/citizenship field. If missing, use country of birth or a clear nationality adjective (e.g., Kenyan).\n- date_of_issue: value near labels such as Date of Issue/Date Issued/Issued On (English, French \"Date de délivrance\", Portuguese \"Data de emissão\").\n- date_of_birth: value near Date of Birth/Date de naissance/Data de nascimento (or equivalent).",
  "licenceDisc": "Document specifics (Vehicle licence disc):\n- licence_number: return the value immediately after the label \"Licence no.\" or \"Lisensienr.\" (e.g., KP68ZGGP).\n  • NEVER return the top header number after NO./NR.\n  • NEVER return the vehicle registration (labels: Veh. register no./Vrt.registernr.) and NEVER a VIN (17 chars).\n  • It must be 5–8 alphanumeric and include at least one letter and one digit.\n  • When both labels exist on the same line (e.g., Lisensienr. KP68ZGGP Vrt.registernr. XKZ090W), choose the token after the Licence label.\n- make: near Make/Fabrikaat.\n- expiry_date: near Date of expiry/Vervaldatum.",
  "driversLicence": "Document specifics (Driver's licence):\n- id_number: capture the national ID or driver ID shown (6–20 digits/alphanumeric). Remove spaces/dashes/slashes and strip prefixes (ID No., Nº, etc.). If multiple IDs appear, choose the one closest to national identity labels.\n- licence_number: take the driver licence number near labels such as LICENCE NUMBER/LICENCE NO/DRIVER LICENSE NO/Nº Permis. Must include both letters and digits; remove separators. Never return a vehicle registration or VIN; if unclear, return null.\n- valid_from and valid_to: derive from the validity range (e.g., 01/12/2021-30/11/2026, 2021-12-01 to 2026-11-30). If only a single expiry date exists, set valid_to and leave valid_from null.\n- first_issue_date: near FIRST ISSUE/DATE OF FIRST ISSUE/Date première délivrance/Data de primeira emissão.\n- codes: list the licence classes/categories granted. Split on spaces/slashes/commas.
