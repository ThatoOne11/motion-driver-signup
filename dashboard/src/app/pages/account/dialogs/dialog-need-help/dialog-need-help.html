  <h3>Scan the QR Code</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Open the authenticator app on your phone. If you don’t have it yet, follow
      the instructions below to download it first.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the app, look for an option to add a new account. This could say "Scan
      QR code," "Add Account," or something similar.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scan the QR code shown on your computer screen using your phone’s camera
      (within the app).
    </li>
    <li>The app will generate a 6-digit code.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Enter the Code</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Enter the 6-digit code from the authenticator app into the box on your
      computer screen.
    </li>
    <li>Click "Submit" to continue.</li>
    <li>If the code is correct, you’ll be logged in to your account.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>What to Do if You Have Trouble Scanning or Entering the Code</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make sure the QR code is clear: Try adjusting your phone's camera or
      moving it closer to the screen if the code doesn’t scan.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the code doesn’t work: Double-check that you entered all 6 digits
      correctly and that you’re using the most recent code from the app (they
      change every 30 seconds).
    </li>
  </ol>
